          <p>The Waterbird Populations Portal (WPP) online database provides current and historic estimates, trends and 1% thresholds for over 800 waterbird species and 2300 biogeographic populations worldwide. The online database makes it easy to obtain information on the status of waterbird species, providing a comprehensive basis for management and decision making.</p>
          <p>All previous editions of the WPE series are included, and the latest Conservation Status Reports for the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement. The main objectives of these series has been to:</p>
          <ol type="i">
            <li>identify wetlands of international importance through the application of the 1% threshold criteria under the Ramsar Convention;</li>
            <li>identify priorities for conservation and research to maintain global waterbird biodiversity;</li>
            <li>identify gaps in knowledge of the world’s waterbird populations;</li>
            <li>support the development of three global conventions – the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, the Convention on Migratory Species and the Convention on Biological Diversity;</li>
            <li>support the development of regional/flyway initiatives, including the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) under the Convention on Migratory Species; the Convention on the Conservation of European Flora and Fauna (Berne Convention); the East Asian - Australasian Flyway (EAAF) Partnership; the European Union Birds Directive; and the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) and the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna.</li>
